A simple tool to read binary DBB databases and output its text equivalent.

This could be used to read the Skype chatlogs (stored unencrypted as chatmsg256.dbb in ~/.Skype/<username>/) 
on some Skype versions. It may not work on the newest Windows-versions, but on my linux-variant (2.2) it
stores these dbb files.


Try this: 

$ ./skypelog chatmsg*.dbb | sort | less
and have fun!

I took the one skypelog.c from this url:
http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/231-Skype-Logs.html
and made it into a gbt project.

If you're new to the gnu build tool like me, here's how you get this built:

klm@lato:/tmp/skypelog (master)$ aclocal
klm@lato:/tmp/skypelog (master)$ autoconf
klm@lato:/tmp/skypelog (master)$ automake -a
klm@lato:/tmp/skypelog (master)$ ./configure 
klm@lato:/tmp/skypelog (master)$ make
klm@lato:/tmp/skypelog (master)$ sudo make install


best of luck!
