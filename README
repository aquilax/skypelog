I took the one skypelog.c file and made it into a gbt project.

See http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/231-Skype-Logs.html

If you're new to the gnu build tool like me, here's how you get this built:

klm@lato:/tmp/skypelog (master)$ aclocal
klm@lato:/tmp/skypelog (master)$ autoconf
klm@lato:/tmp/skypelog (master)$ automake -a
klm@lato:/tmp/skypelog (master)$ ./configure 
klm@lato:/tmp/skypelog (master)$ make
klm@lato:/tmp/skypelog (master)$ sudo make install


best of luck!
